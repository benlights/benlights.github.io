### How not to Ask


A few months ago I was playing around with Kali Linux using a virtual machine in windows. I was having a problem switching to the Superuser using the `su` command.

#### Below is my question the way I originally posted it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### su cannot execute bin/bash/****

Hi I installed kali Linux on a vm machine and I cannot change my user to root from the terminal using su. sudo works fine but whe I try su it says   cannot execute bin/bash/****(my user name) not a directory.


Thank you,


#### And this is what a helpful user turned it into.

Looking at the differences he did not change much if at all in terms of technical info. Where he did shine though is making my question readable. The question I submitted looked like a tweenager text. Looking back now I do not know if I would have answered it myself, seeing as the poster (me) did not really have any attention to detail.


And yes my question was answered and it resolved my issue.
